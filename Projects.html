                <h3>Ikelelloe – Mind Your Mind</h3>
                <p class="opacity">Project Overview</p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    “Ikelelloe” means be aware of yourself,and through this project, Healthy Minds Advocacy (HeMA) invites children to do just that: to mind their minds. Launched in 2023, Ikelelloe creates safe and creative spaces for children to express themselves, build resilience, and heal from the emotional impact of their surroundings.
                    Originally sparked by the rising family conflicts and violent incidents in the community, the project offers <b>play therapy</b>, <b>art therapy</b>, and <b>peer observation </b>to support children’s mental well-being.
                    We currently work with three schools, using activities like:
                    <ul>
                    <li>	🎨 Art and crafts – for emotional expression
                    <li>	♟️ Chess – to develop focus and critical thinking
                    <li>	🎶 Singing – to foster joy and community
                    <li>  🌱 Life skills sessions – to equip children with tools for emotional regulation and self-awareness
                    </ul>
                    We also observe how children interact with each other and offer individual counseling where needed.
                    Ikelelloe is an ongoing journey, helping children grow into mindful, emotionally aware individuals ,one activity, one conversation, one child at a time.
