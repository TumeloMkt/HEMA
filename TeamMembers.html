                    <h3>Litsitso Mokhothu</h3>
                    <p class="opacity">Founder</p>
                    <p>
                        Litšitso Mokhothu, born and raised in Maseru East, is the founder of Healthy Minds Advocacy (HeMA), an initiative dedicated to promoting children’s mental health, neurodivergence awareness, and emotional resilience in Lesotho.<br>
                        With a degree in Urban and Regional Planning, Litšitso brings a unique blend of community engagement, cultural heritage preservation, and youth advocacy to her work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Her journey as an advocate began long before HeMA. In 2021, she served as the interim chairperson of Jabari International, a mental health awareness organization, where she led impactful initiatives such as Lesotho’s World Mental Health Day events, including art therapy workshops, and organized outreach to a school for children with cerebral palsy, combining donations with mental health education.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since 2022, she has also served as a board member for the Nomapads Foundation, after volunteering with the organization on menstrual health education and hygiene projects. This included visiting schools to teach menstrual health and distribute reusable pads to learners in need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alongside her mental health work, Litšitso volunteers with Seriti sa Makhoarane on heritage restoration in Makeneng, where she focuses on heritage zoning and leads cultural projects for children, such as the Sesotho writing program connecting young readers with the authors of their schoolbooks. She has also received international training in photogrammetry, 3D terrestrial laser scanning, and GIS for heritage management in Greece, enhancing her ability to document and safeguard cultural sites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through HeMA, Litšitso channels her diverse experiences into creating safe, creative, and inclusive spaces where children can thrive—mind, body, and spirit.
